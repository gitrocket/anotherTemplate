This is a very simple, quick-and-dirty, single-page website. 

It follows a mobile-first responsive design, and was built using bootstrap and jQuery.

It features an animated, sticky navbar component. 

Elements are laid out in bootstrap's native flex box grid, with the main content section consisting of 10/2-column rows -- with 10 columns of space devoted to text, and 2 columns to a photo.

jQuery is used to slide down the navbar when the document is loaded.

It follows a simple pattern -- with a header, section content, and a footer.

Additional content and features will be added periodically.
